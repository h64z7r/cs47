Course   Description
This course   will   introduce students   to   the   meaning   and   significance   of   spiritual   practice   in   its distinctively   Christian   expressions   and   expressions   associated   with   other   traditions.   The   focus   of   the   course is on   “lived   religion”–the   embodied, eclectic, and   often   improvisational character of   spiritual   experience,   both collective   and   individual.   It   also   seeks   to   understand   the critical   role of   practice in shaping   spiritual   meaning   and   identity.
With a   few exceptions, this course   will approach the study of   lived   religion   from a sociological   perspective.   A sociological perspective on religion focuses on   religious   practices,   customs,   beliefs,   and rituals in the context of   social structures such as religious   institutions,   politics, education,   community, and family. In this class, students   will learn about   the dialectical   processes   by   which religion affects societies and societies affect   religion by addressing   the following   three questions:
1) How do social scientists approach the study of   religion?
2)   What can religion tell   us about   a   particular   group or society?
3)   Why is it important   to study   religion   within the socio-historical context in   which it   is   produced,   reproduced, and reconfigured?
The course   will introduce students to classic and contemporary   theories and approaches to   the   study of   lived religion. Students   will learn about   the benefits and challenges of   using   methods such   as case studies, in-depth interviews, participant observation, and ethnography, and they   will   approach the study of   religion through gender,   race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class, among   other topics. Given the increasingly diverse and multicultural   landscape of   the United States,   students   will learn how   gender,   race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class, among other aspects of   social location, mutually   reinforce one another and shape the   ways   we interpret, understand, and   live out   religious   worlds.
Core   Curriculum
This   course supplies   foundational   religious   literacy   and   prepares   students   for   more   advanced   work   in   the   Core Curriculum. It   fulfills   the   Foundations   core   course   in   Theological   Inquiry   and   will   be   helpful   to take   before   registering   for   an   Integrations   core   course   in   Faith   and   Reason.
Course   Learning   Outcomes
By   the   end   of   this   course   you   will   be   able   to:
•          Critically   read and evaluate   various   theories and   methodologies   within   the study   of   religion.
•          Demonstrate   knowledge of   a   diversity   of   religious   traditions   with special attention   to   Catholic Christianity.
•          Identify   and apply   key   terms   within   the study   of   religion.
•          Analyze and discuss interpretive   issues   within   the study   of   religion   and   identify   limits   to
knowledge   and   how   such   limits influence scholarly   analyses   and interpretations   of   religious   phenomena.
•          Formulate and express arguments and analyses   with clarity   both   verbally   and in   writing.

At   the start   of   the semester,   you   will   have   the   opportunity   to set   goals   related   to   what   you   want   to   achieve   in   the   course   and   create   a   plan   to   do so.   There   will   be   opportunities   to   assess   your   progress   at   the midterm   and   at   the   end   of   the   course,   as   well.
Religious   Autobiography   Assignment   (15%)
I invite   you   to   consider   your   relationship   to   religion   and choose   a   song   that   reflects   that   relationship.
You   will   upload   your songs   to a   Spotify   playlist,   note   your   name,   the   title   of   the   song,   and   the   artist   on   a   GoogleSheet, and   listen   to   them in   preparation   for   class   the   following   week.   In   class,   you   will   give   a   mini-presentation   of   no   more   than   three   minutes,   in   which   you   introduce   yourselves   by   name,   class   year,   and   major and   address   these   questions:   What   is   your   relationship   to   religion   at   this   point   in   time?   How does   this song   reflect   that   relationship?   Is   there anything   about   your   relationship   to   religion   the song   doesn’t   address   that   is   important   for   us   to   know?   Due   dates   are   listed   on   the   chart   below   and   in   the   Schedule   of   Readings.
Exam (20%)The   exam   will   be   cumulative,   including   questions   on   material   from   up-to-date   course   readings,   lectures,   and   class   discussions.   Questions   will   be   asked   in   a   mix   of   formats,   e.g.   multiple   choice,   true/false, short   answer,   and   long   answer,   and   a study   guide   will   be   provided   on   Brightspace.
Campus   Event   (5%)
Students   are invited   to   choose   from   a   list   of   relevant   campus   events   to   attend.   You   will   email   a   photo   of   yourselves   at   the   event   when it   takes   place.   In   class,   you   will   give   a   presentation   of   no   more   than   five   minutes, in   which   you   highlight   three   ideas   from   the event   that   stood   out   to   you and   explain   how   those   ideas   inform   your   understanding   of   lived   religion.

You   will   have   the opportunity   to   interview   a   religious   leader about   no   fewer   than   three   of   the   topics   listed   on   the syllabus.   I   will   provide   a   list   of   religious   leaders   who   are   open   to   meeting   with   you,   and   you are also   welcomed   to seek   out   a   religious   leader   on   your   own.   Students   will   analyze   the   in-depth interview      using   course   readings   and   the   fruit   of   their   independent   research.

How   to   Prepare   for   Class
(1)   If   something   is   unclear   to   you, consult   this   syllabus,   the course   policies,   and   Brightspace.   If   you   don’t   find   your answer,   ask   another   student.   If   the   two   of   you   don’t   have   an   answer,   please   bring   your   question   to   class   and   ask   it, so   everyone   can   be   on the same   page.
(2)   Have   an   organization system.   This   includes   one   place   where   you   keep   all   your   class notes,   one         place   where   you   keep   all   your   handouts,   one   place   where   you   keep   all   your   assignments,   and   one   place where   you   keep   all   your   readings   and   reading   notes.   I   encourage   you   to   consider   printing each   reading   and   marking   them   up   with   a   p代 写THST 1050-07 In Search of a Way Fall Semester, 2024Python
代做程序编程语言en   or   pencil   and   taking   notes   by   hand,   as   writing notes   by   hand   boosts   your   learning. Be   sure   to   bring   these   things   with   you every   class   meeting.
(3)   As   you   read   …
a.         …take   note   of   terms   that   are   new   to   you.   Look   for   context   clues   elsewhere   in   the
sentence   or   paragraph   that   can   help   you   determine   the   meaning   on   your   own   and/or   look   it   up in a   dictionary.   If   you’re   still   unsure   of   its   meaning,   bring   your   question   to   class;   chances   are,   at   least   one   other   person   would   benefit   from   your   question   being      answered.
b.       …take note in   your own   words of   three ideas   that   stood   out   to   you (e.g. something   new      you   have   never   heard   of   before, something   you’re   curious about),   where   you   found it   in   the   text (e.g.   pg. 7,   2nd   paragraph) and one   clarifying   question or question   you’dlike   to discuss   further.   A   clarifying   question   asks   for   information,   whereas   a   discussion   question   is   evaluative   and   often   askshow   or   why.


NB:   These   lists   of   three   ideas   and   a   question   will   be   collected   at   random   throughout   the   semester.   Points   will   be included in   your   Class   Attendance   and Participation   grade.
Syllabus   as   Living   Document
This syllabus   is   a   living   document, subject   to   change.   As such,   it   maybe   modified   according   to   the   gifts         and   needs   of   the students in   the   course.   If   modifications   are   made,   students   will   be   notified in   class   or   via   Brightspace   to   adapt   to   those   changes.   While   course   readings maybe swapped,   no   new   mandatory readings   or   new   mandatory   assignments   will   be   added   to   this   document.
Schedule   of   Readings
Readings,   handouts,   and   web   content   will   be shared   with   you   on   Brightspace.
Please   prepare   to   discuss   them   in   class   on the   dates listed   below.
